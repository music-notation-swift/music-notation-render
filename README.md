# music-notation-render

This is a **work in progress**, Cross-Platform Music Notation API written in Swift.
This is the package that implements the rendering for the base [music-notation](https://github.com/music-notation-swift/music-notation) package.
It is written so that it can be used in most any operating system, such as iOS, macOS, tvOS. Windows & Linux is aspirational at this point, but since the plan is to avoid dependencies, this should not be much of a stretch.

Please consult this [Swift style guide](https://github.com/music-notation-swift/swift-style-guide) for coding style guidelines used in this repo and be sure to adhere to them.

There is a Slack channel you can join if you want to see more into the development process at [Music Notation Swift Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/musicnotationswift/shared_invite/enQtOTE1NzQyMzI5MTA2LWZlN2MyNmI5MjA2Njc4MGQ5N2IxNzYzY2QxMmYwNmFlNDNmNjUwNjBlMGY1MWIzNDkxMzY2MzAwNjc4NTJkNjU).
